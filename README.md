# SEA8 - Spring Quest - Consommer une API avec WebClient

## Challenge: Star Wars API

Make a fork of the following repository: <https://github.com/WildCodeSchool/spring-swapi>.

You are taking over the development of a Star Wars fan site in order to add features to it. At the moment, it is possible to search for a character using his ID.

The API used is accessible at this address: <https://swapi.dev/>.

You can already test the site and see how it all works.

Your mission is to add the search for planets by ID. For example, the API url for planet 1 will be: <https://swapi.dev/api/planets/1/>.

> The "/" at the end of the url is important!

## Validation criteria

- When calling the planet search form, the name and number of inhabitants of the planet appear correctly.
- The data is correctly retrieved from the API.
- A conversion from JSON to the Planet type has been performed.
